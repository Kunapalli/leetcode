# https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/
# The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard such that no
# two queens attack each other.
# Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
# Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both
# indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.

# Just a simple application of recursion with backtracking.
# Leftdiag = diagonals sloping left (negative slope) and rightdiag = diagonals sloping right (positive slope)
# if a row has a queen, then row[i] is true
# if a column has a queen then column[i] is true
# if a queen is at (i,j), then its left diagonal leftDiag[i+j] = true and
# its right diagonal rightDiag[j - i + n -1] = true
